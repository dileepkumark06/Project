# Project
Detection of Fruit Adulteration using Machine Learning

• Developed a machine learning model using Python to detect fruit adulteration with an accuracy of 95%.
• Extracted relevant features from a large dataset of food samples, including sensory properties using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
• Trained the model using popular algorithms such as KNN, SVM Gaussian Kernel, SVM Linear Kernel, and evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and       precision.
• Deployed the model on a web-based platform, enabling quick and efficient detection of fruit adulteration in real-time.
